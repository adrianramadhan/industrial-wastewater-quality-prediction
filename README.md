# Industrial Wastewater Quality Prediction API
This project provides a RESTful API to predict the quality of industrial wastewater using machine learning models. The API is built using the Flask framework, following the Clean Architecture approach. The dataset consists of various water quality parameters, including pH, conductivity, turbidity, TSS, BOD, COD, Total Coliform, and Color.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

- pH: Acidity/alkalinity level.
- Conductivity: The ability of water to conduct electric current.
- Turbidity: Clarity of the water.
- TSS: Total suspended solids.
- BOD: Biochemical oxygen demand.
- COD: Chemical oxygen demand.
- Total Coliform: Indicator of bacterial contamination.
- Color: The color of the water sample.
** Target Variable
You can choose any of the above features as the target variable (Y) to predict based on the other features (X).
